  # @apiDescription
  #   This creates a badge action. A badge action is a record of something done of a particular action type in the app.
  #   Badge actions are earned toward unearned badges of the action type matching the badge action. This call returns
  #   either an array of earned badges or an object called pending_badge with the points earned so far and the badge info.
  #   If more than one badge has been partially earned, the badge with the highest percentage earned is returned.
  #

  #   The badge_action object container.

  #   The internal name of the badge action.
  #
  # @apiParam (body) {String} [badge_action.identifier]
  #   The identifier for this badge action.
